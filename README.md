# Fantasy Draft Assistance

## Overview
Fantasy Picker is a tool designed to help users make informed decisions for their fantasy sports teams. It takes three different data sources to help make a decision for your next pick!

## Features

- Player recommendations based on different sources
- User-friendly interface

2. Navigate to the project directory:
